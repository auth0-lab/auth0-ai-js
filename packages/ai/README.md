# Auth0 AI SDK

`@auth0/ai` is an SDK for building secure AI-powered applications using [Auth0](https://www.auth0.ai/).

This SDK provides base abstractions for authentication and authorization in AI applications including a set of tools for implementing [asynchronous user authentication](https://demo.auth0.ai/docs/async-user-confirmation) using the [Client Initiated Backchannel Authentication (CIBA)](https://openid.net/specs/openid-client-initiated-backchannel-authentication-core-1_0.html) protocol.

> `@auth0/ai` is currently **under heavy development**. We strictly follow [Semantic Versioning (SemVer)](https://semver.org/), meaning all **breaking changes will only occur in major versions**. However, please note that during this early phase, **major versions may be released frequently** as the API evolves. We recommend locking versions when using this in production.
