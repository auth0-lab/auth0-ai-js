# Chat SPA Application with Auth0 AI and AI SDK and Federated Connection Access Tokens

The following app demonstrates using a SPA chatbot application, a backend API (and a linked API client), and a federated
connection to a third party API.

## Features

This template leverages [bhvr](https://github.com/stevedylandev/bhvr) template for building a React SPA application with a Hono API.

- **Full-Stack TypeScript**: End-to-end type safety between client and server
- **Shared Types**: Common type definitions shared between client and server
- **Monorepo Structure**: Organized as a workspaces-based monorepo with Turbo for build orchestration
- **Modern Stack**:
  - [Bun](https://bun.sh) as the JavaScript runtime and package manager
  - [Hono](https://hono.dev) as the backend framework
  - [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) for frontend bundling
  - [React](https://react.dev) for the frontend UI
  - [Turbo](https://turbo.build) for monorepo build orchestration and caching

## Getting Started

### Quick Start

#### Auth0 Setup and Deployment

// todo: list all the installation steps, and later automate with auth0 cli.

### Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies for all workspaces
bun install
```

### Development

```bash
# Run all workspaces in development mode with Turbo
bun run dev

# Or run individual workspaces directly
bun run dev:client    # Run the Vite dev server for React
bun run dev:server    # Run the Hono backend
```

### Building

```bash
# Build all workspaces with Turbo
bun run build

# Or build individual workspaces directly
bun run build:client  # Build the React frontend
bun run build:server  # Build the Hono backend
```

### Additional Commands

```bash
# Lint all workspaces
bun run lint

# Type check all workspaces
bun run type-check

# Run tests across all workspaces
bun run test
```

### Deployment

Deplying each piece is very versatile and can be done numerous ways, and exploration into automating these will happen at a later date. Here are some references in the meantime.

**Client**
- [Orbiter](https://orbiter.host)
- [GitHub Pages](https://vite.dev/guide/static-deploy.html#github-pages)
- [Netlify](https://vite.dev/guide/static-deploy.html#netlify)
- [Cloudflare Pages](https://vite.dev/guide/static-deploy.html#cloudflare-pages)

**Server**
- [Cloudflare Worker](https://gist.github.com/stevedylandev/4aa1fc569bcba46b7169193c0498d0b3)
- [Bun](https://hono.dev/docs/getting-started/bun)
- [Node.js](https://hono.dev/docs/getting-started/nodejs)

## Type Sharing

Types are automatically shared between the client and server thanks to the shared package and TypeScript path aliases. You can import them in your code using:

```typescript
import { ApiResponse } from 'shared/types';
```
