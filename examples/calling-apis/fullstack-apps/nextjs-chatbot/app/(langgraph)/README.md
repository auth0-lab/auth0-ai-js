## Auth0 AI + LangGraph - Calling APIs on user's behalf example

This example demonstrates how to integrate **Auth0 AI SDK** with **LangGraph** to call APIs on user's behalf. It showcases the process of obtaining user authorization and calling an external API using the LangGraph framework.

> [!WARNING]
> For this example to work as expected you need to run a local LangGraph server. You can do this by running the following command from the [/examples/calling-apis/chatbot](/examples/calling-apis/chatbot/) path:
>
> ```bash
> npm run langgraph:dev
> ```
